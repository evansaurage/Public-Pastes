## üß† What Makes A1502 Recovery Unique

- Intel-based MacBook Pro 13‚Äù with T1/T2 chip not present (no Secure Enclave restrictions on recovery).  
- Uses traditional Intel EFI-based Recovery (not Apple Silicon recovery).  
- Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware specifics can affect network detection.  
- Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter often required for more stable recovery network.  
- NVRAM and SMC reset commands can be critical on these models if network hangs occur.  
- Slightly different default network interface names (`en0` usually Wi‚ÄëFi, `en3` or `en4` Thunderbolt Ethernet).  
- A1502 model identifiers: MacBookPro12,1 (2015), MacBookPro13,1 (2016), MacBookPro14,1 (2017). OS compatibility: macOS 10.12 Sierra ‚Üí 12.x Monterey.

---

## üö® Immediate Prerequisites

- A1502 MacBook Pro in Recovery Mode (`Cmd + R`).  
- Terminal open from Utilities menu.  
- Wi‚ÄëFi connected and captive portal completed (Safari usable) or Ethernet connected.  
- Power adapter connected.  
- Physical access to the machine.  
- Recommended: Thunderbolt ‚Üí Ethernet adapter for wired install.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recovery Environment Tools

Run these to confirm the Recovery environment has the tools necessary:

```bash
echo "=== Available Recovery Tools ==="
which scutil
which networksetup
which nslookup
which dns-sd
which curl
echo "=== Basic System Info ==="
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -E "Model Identifier|Serial Number"
networksetup -listallhardwareports
```

Expected: should show Mac model (e.g., `MacBookPro13,x`) and network interfaces.

If tools are missing or output is unexpected, note it before proceeding.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Step-by-Step DNS Bypass and Hardening

This section provides multiple methods preserved verbatim. Use the ones appropriate for your environment. Apply only on authorized systems.

### Network Assessment

```bash
echo "=== Current Network Status ==="
scutil --nwi
scutil --dns | head -20
networksetup -listallnetworkservices
```

### Global DNS Override (Primary Method)

```bash
echo "=== Implementing Global DNS Bypass ==="
scutil << EOF
open
get State:/Network/Global/IPv4
d.add ServerAddresses * 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9 149.112.112.112 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
set State:/Network/Global/IPv4
close
EOF
echo "Global DNS override complete"
```

When to use: preferred when Recovery is allowed to use scutil and you require a session-only override that avoids editing system files directly.

### Service-Specific DNS (Alternative)

```bash
echo "=== Service-Specific DNS Configuration ==="
for service in $(scutil <<< "list" | grep "State:/Network/Service" | awk -F'/| ' '{print $4}'); do
  echo "Configuring $service..."
  scutil << EOF
open
get State:/Network/Service/${service}/DNS
d.add ServerAddresses * 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9
set State:/Network/Service/${service}/DNS
close
EOF
done
```

When to use: if global override is unavailable or you prefer per-service DNS configuration.

### Hardened Hosts File (Automated ‚Äî overwrite `/etc/hosts`)

```bash
echo "=== Creating Hardened Hosts File ==="
cat > /etc/hosts << 'EOF'
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# Apple Installation Servers (A1502 Specific)
17.253.22.204  swcdn.apple.com
17.253.22.207  gg.apple.com
17.253.22.205  oscdn.apple.com
17.253.22.206  swscan.apple.com
17.253.22.203  mesu.apple.com
17.253.22.202  gdmf.apple.com

# Secure DNS Providers
1.1.1.1        one.one.one.one
1.0.0.1        one.one.one.one
9.9.9.9        dns.quad9.net
149.112.112.112 dns.quad9.net
8.8.8.8        dns.google

# Block Telemetry
0.0.0.0        metrics.icloud.com
0.0.0.0        metrics.apple.com
0.0.0.0        sequoia.apple.com
EOF
echo "Hosts file configured"
```

When to use: when DNS-based filtering prevents domain resolution and a direct IP-to-hostname override is required. Note: overwrites any existing hosts entries.

### Manual Hosts Editing With vi (Fallback)

```bash
vi /etc/hosts
```

Basic vi instructions (in Recovery where `nano` may not exist):
- Press `i` to enter insert mode.  
- Paste or type your entries.  
- Press `Esc` to exit insert mode.  
- Type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit.

When to use: when heredoc or `cat` is not available or you need to make curated edits.

### DNS Testing

```bash
echo "=== Testing DNS Bypass ==="
nslookup apple.com 1.1.1.1
nslookup swcdn.apple.com
ping -c 2 gg.apple.com
ping -c 2 oscdn.apple.com
```

### Cache Flush

```bash
echo "=== Flushing DNS Cache ==="
dscacheutil -flushcache
killall -HUP mDNSResponder
scutil --dns | head -10
```

---

## ‚úÖ Installation Validation

Full validation loop preserved verbatim:

```bash
echo "=== Apple Server Validation ==="
CRITICAL_DOMAINS=(
"swcdn.apple.com"
"gg.apple.com" 
"oscdn.apple.com"
"swdist.apple.com"
"swscan.apple.com"
"mesu.apple.com"
"gdmf.apple.com"
)

for domain in "${CRITICAL_DOMAINS[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing $domain:"
    nslookup $domain 2>/dev/null | grep -E "Address:|name ="
    ping -c 1 -t 2 $domain 2>/dev/null | grep "bytes from" || echo "Ping timeout"
    echo "---"
done
```

Use this loop to confirm that Recovery can reach Apple CDNs and installer hosts before attempting reinstall. Successful nslookup results and at least one ping response indicate readiness.

---

## A1502 Step-By-Step Recovery Walkthrough (Alternative presentation of combined steps)

This walkthrough preserves all commands and ordering from the original materials and includes additional model-specific commands.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Verify Model and Recovery Environment

```bash
echo "=== Model Info ==="
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -E "Model Identifier|Serial Number|Model Name"
nvram -p | grep recovery
```

Expected: should show `MacBookPro12,x`, `MacBookPro13,x`, or `MacBookPro14,x` and recovery nvram lines.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Identify Network Interfaces

```bash
echo "=== Network Interfaces ==="
networksetup -listallhardwareports
ifconfig -l
ifconfig | grep inet
echo "=== Network Services ==="
networksetup -listallnetworkservices
```

Note: A1502 may use nonstandard interface names for Thunderbolt Ethernet (e.g., `en3`, `en4`). Always verify interfaces via `networksetup -listallhardwareports` and `ifconfig -l`.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Set Secure DNS (preferred order: Ethernet then Wi‚ÄëFi)

```bash
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9 149.112.112.112
networksetup -setdnsservers "Thunderbolt Ethernet" 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9 149.112.112.112
networksetup -ordernetworkservices "Thunderbolt Ethernet" "Wi-Fi"
```

When to use: Use Thunderbolt Ethernet if available for stable download. Adjust service names if your interface names differ.

### Step 4 ‚Äî Reset Network Configuration & Boot Args (optional/advanced)

```bash
nvram -c                                      # Clear NVRAM variables
nvram boot-args="-no_dns_relay"              # Disable DNS relay (reduces captive portal issues)
ipconfig set en0 DHCP                        # Renew Wi-Fi IP
ipconfig set en1 DHCP                        # Renew Ethernet IP
```

Caveat: `nvram boot-args` could alter boot behavior; use only with authorization and revert post‚Äëinstall with `nvram -d boot-args`.

### Step 5 ‚Äî Harden `/etc/hosts` (automated method recommended)

See the Hardened Hosts File block above for the full heredoc that overwrites `/etc/hosts`. This block includes Apple installer IPs, fallback DNS provider names, and telemetry blocks.

### Step 6 ‚Äî Test Network & Apple Servers

```bash
echo "=== Network Interface Status ==="
ifconfig en0 | grep "status:"
ifconfig en1 | grep "status:"

echo "=== DNS Resolution Test ==="
nslookup apple.com 1.1.1.1
nslookup swcdn.apple.com

echo "=== Ping Apple CDN ==="
ping -c 2 swcdn.apple.com
ping -c 2 gg.apple.com
```

### Step 7 ‚Äî Flush DNS and Restart Services

```bash
dscacheutil -flushcache
killall -HUP mDNSResponder
scutil --dns
```

### Step 8 ‚Äî Reinstall macOS

```bash
echo "=== READY FOR INSTALLATION ==="
echo "1. Close Terminal"
echo "2. Select 'Reinstall macOS'"
echo "3. Choose recommended macOS version (Monterey or earlier for A1502)"
echo "4. Follow prompts to complete install"
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Emergency Recovery Options

This section contains every troubleshooting command and emergency fallback from the three sources.

### Network Reset Options (preserved verbatim)

```bash
echo "=== Network Reset Options ==="
echo "1. Interface reset:"
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" empty
networksetup -setdhcp "Wi-Fi"
echo "2. Manual refresh:"
ipconfig set en0 DHCP
echo "3. Cache flush:"
dscacheutil -flushcache
```

### Emergency Recovery Options (preserved verbatim)

```bash
echo "=== Emergency Options ==="
echo "If installation still fails:"
echo "1. Try Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter"
echo "2. Use personal hotspot"
echo "3. Create bootable installer on another Mac"
echo "4. Contact IT for network exemption"
```

When to use: If hardened DNS and hosts overrides fail to allow Recovery to fetch installers, fall back to wired Ethernet, personal hotspot tethering, or a local bootable installer.

### Installer Log and Debugging (preserved)

```bash
log show --predicate 'process == "osinstaller"' --last 30m
```

Use the above to inspect installer logs when the installer stalls or fails.

### DNS Resolution Troubleshooting (preserved)

```bash
# Reset Wi-Fi
networksetup -setairportpower en0 off
sleep 2
networksetup -setairportpower en0 on

# Test with different DNS providers
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220

# Verify connectivity
curl -I https://apple.com

# Test DNS port reachability
nc -z 1.1.1.1 53
nc -z 8.8.8.8 53
```

### NVRAM and SMC Resets (preserved and explicit)

#### Reset NVRAM (Recovery Terminal)

```bash
nvram -c
```

#### SMC Reset (Intel MacBook Pro with nonremovable battery)

1. Shutdown  
2. Press and hold Left Shift + Control + Option + Power for 10 seconds  
3. Release and power on

Use when power management, charging, or network interface behaviors appear inconsistent after other steps.

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators & Ready-to-Install Checklist

Ready to install when:
- `nslookup swcdn.apple.com` returns Apple IPs  
- `ping gg.apple.com` gets responses  
- No DNS timeouts or "server can't find" errors  
- Can access "Reinstall macOS" from Recovery without network errors

Installation steps:
1. Close Terminal  
2. Select "Reinstall macOS" from Utilities  
3. Choose recommended version (macOS 10.12‚Äì12.x for A1502 where applicable)  
4. Follow installation prompts until completion

---

## Post-Install Cleanup & Security Checks (DNSSEC, hosts removal)

Run these in the newly installed macOS (or Recovery after install) to restore defaults and verify secure DNS behavior:

```bash
# Restore default hosts file
sudo rm /etc/hosts

# Reset to automatic DNS
sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi empty

# Verify normal operation
networksetup -getdnsservers "Wi-Fi"

# Clear custom boot args if set
sudo nvram -d boot-args || true

# DNSSEC and dig checks (run from installed macOS)
scutil --dns | grep "DNSSEC"
dig apple.com +dnssec
dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net
dig sigok.verteiltesysteme.net
```

Notes: Most Recovery changes are ephemeral and will not persist after full install, but explicitly remove overrides to ensure a clean production environment.
