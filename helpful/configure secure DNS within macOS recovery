Say you're in macOS Recovery with no OS installed yet, we can work within these constraints to establish secure DNS for the OS installation.

## Step 1: Check Available Tools in Recovery

First, let's see what we have available:

```bash
# Check available network utilities
which scutil
which networksetup
which dns-sd
which nslookup
```

## Step 2: Establish Basic Network Connectivity

```bash
# Check current network status
scutil --nwi

# Get current DNS settings
scutil --dns

# List network services
networksetup -listallnetworkservices
```

## Step 3: Configure DNS Directly via scutil (Primary Method)

Since we may not have full `networksetup` functionality in Recovery:

```bash
# Configure DNS for all active services using scutil
scutil << EOF
open
get State:/Network/Global/IPv4
d.add ServerAddresses * 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9 149.112.112.112
set State:/Network/Global/IPv4
close
EOF

# Alternative: Configure per service
for service in $(scutil <<< "list" | grep "State:/Network/Service" | awk -F'/| ' '{print $4}'); do
scutil << EOF
open
get State:/Network/Service/${service}/DNS
d.add ServerAddresses * 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9
set State:/Network/Service/${service}/DNS
close
EOF
done
```

## Step 4: Create Minimal Hosts File in Recovery

```bash
# Create basic hosts file in recovery environment
cat > /etc/hosts << 'EOF'
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# Secure DNS servers - direct IP mapping
1.1.1.1         one.one.one.one
1.0.0.1         one.one.one.one
9.9.9.9         dns.quad9.net
149.112.112.112 dns.quad9.net
8.8.8.8         dns.google
EOF
```

## Step 5: Test DNS Resolution

```bash
# Test DNS resolution with different servers
nslookup apple.com 1.1.1.1
nslookup apple.com 9.9.9.9

# Test if we can reach Apple installation servers
ping -c 3 swcdn.apple.com
ping -c 3 gs.apple.com

# Check if we can resolve critical Apple domains
nslookup swscan.apple.com
nslookup gg.apple.com
nslookup oscdn.apple.com
```

## Step 6: Force DNS Cache Refresh

```bash
# Clear any DNS caches (limited in recovery)
dscacheutil -flushcache
killall -HUP mDNSResponder

# Alternative method
scutil --dns
```

## Step 7: Configure Network for Installation

If standard methods don't work, try manual network configuration:

```bash
# Get current network interface
networksetup -getinfo "Ethernet"
networksetup -getinfo "Wi-Fi"

# Set DNS for specific interfaces (replace with your interface name)
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9
networksetup -setdnsservers "Ethernet" 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 9.9.9.9
```

## Step 8: Test Apple's Installation Servers

```bash
# Test critical Apple domains for installation
echo "Testing Apple installation servers:"

CRITICAL_DOMAINS=(
"swcdn.apple.com"
"gg.apple.com" 
"oscdn.apple.com"
"swdist.apple.com"
"swscan.apple.com"
"mesu.apple.com"
"gdmf.apple.com"
)

for domain in "${CRITICAL_DOMAINS[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing $domain:"
    nslookup $domain 1.1.1.1
    echo "---"
done
```

## Step 9: Bypass Potential DNS Blocks

If DNS is still being blocked, try these workarounds:

```bash
# Use Google DNS as fallback (less likely to be blocked)
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

# Or use multiple redundant DNS servers
networksetup -setdnsservers "Wi-Fi" 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9 208.67.222.222
```

## Step 10: Attempt macOS Installation

Now try the macOS installation:

```bash
# Start installer (this will vary based on your recovery version)
echo "DNS should now be configured. Attempt installation via:"
echo "1. Reboot and try macOS installation again"
echo "2. Use 'Reinstall macOS' from Recovery utilities"
echo "3. If using Internet Recovery, restart Internet Recovery"
```

## Step 11: Emergency Network Reset

If nothing works, reset network configuration:

```bash
# Remove all network preferences
rm -rf /var/preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist

# Restart network services (limited in recovery)
# May require reboot of recovery environment
```

## Verification Steps:

After configuration, verify with:

```bash
# Check current DNS settings
scutil --dns | head -20

# Test connectivity to Apple
curl -I https://apple.com

# Verify we can reach installation servers
nslookup swcdn.apple.com
```

## Important Recovery Notes:

- **Limited Tools**: Recovery has minimal network utilities
- **Temporary Settings**: Some settings may reset on reboot
- **Internet Recovery**: If using Internet Recovery, DNS is crucial for downloading the installer
- **Hardware Differences**: M1/M2 Macs may have different recovery behavior
